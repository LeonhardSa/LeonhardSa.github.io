									<h1>about me</h1>
									<p>Leonhard Samonig a programmer with decades of gaming experience<br />
									and years of programming education.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/gamer.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>In terms of programming, I have 5 years of experience in Java, a few school projects with C++, where Arduinos where used during vocational high school, while the unversity was a 3 year mix of using Unity and Unreal Engine as well as some C++. With a healthy knowledge of 8 years, I see my programming skill personally on the average side going by experience per year, but I make it work with my talent of problem solving. I developed this skill since I have a tendency to not search for solutionss in life, but for ways that can help me implement my own idea that can solve the problem. This also caused me to do yearly things like dungeon generators and solving algorithm problems from online websites now and then, since they always tend to give me a new challenge for me to experience. New challenges and problems like this are something that I look forward to in projects. </p>
								<p>And if you are asking yourself how I even got here. As the youngest in the family I had many moments, where I was influenced and experienced the behaviour of the older siblings. This caused me to go to a vocational high school with a focus on electronics and technical informatics, that includes everything from hardware to software and from programming to server management. During my second to last year I had to take a compulsory subject and decided on Game Development, from that day on I knew my favorite subject. After getting my Autrian equivalent to a high school diploma, I signed up at the SAE Institute Wien in Vienna, where I submitted my project for my Bachelor of Sience in Spring of 2023.</p>
