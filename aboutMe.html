									<h1>about me</h1>
									<p>Leonhard Samonig a programmer with decades of gaming experience<br />
									and years of programming education.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/gamer.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>In terms of programming, I have accumulated 5 years of experience in Java, completed several school projects utilizing C++ and Arduinos during vocational high school, and pursued a 3-year university program that involved a mix of Unity, Unreal Engine, and C++. With a solid background of 8 years, I consider my knowledge to be average for a timeframe of 8 years, but I excel and balance it out with problem-solving abilities. My inclination towards seeking original my own solution rather than searching for pre-existing ones has helped me hone this skill. To keep myself fit in this regard, I engage in yearly pursuits such as creating dungeon generators and solving algorithmic problems on online platforms. I thrive on new challenges and opportunities to problem-solve in projects.</p>
								<p>And if you are asking yourself how I even got here. As the youngest in my family, I often observed and was influenced by the behavior of my older siblings. This led me to pursue a vocational high school education with a focus on electronics and technical informatics, covering everything from hardware and software to programming and server management. During my second-to-last year of high school, I took a compulsory subject in Game Development, which quickly became my favorite subject. After finishing my Matura (the Austrian equivalent of a high school diploma), I enrolled at the SAE Institute Wien in Vienna and submitted my project for my Bachelor of Science degree in the Spring of 2023.</p>
