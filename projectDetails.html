								<p>As my final solo project during university, I attempted to incorporate portals and non-Euclidean geometry into a puzzle game demo. The end result included portals, custom gravity, and rooms that could distort during gameplay.<br />
								To represent the portals, I set up a camera at the other side and used a camera render texture to display what was beyond. The portals were then given the ability to scale objects that passed through and change the gravity of the player and unique blocks.<br />
								For the distorting room feature, I created a script that scanned an area for all objects, and the room was set up to have a distortion strength and direction for each of its eight corners. Depending on an object's position, it would have a different influence on the distortion effect. 
								Rather than moving the objects themselves, I updated every vertex in the mesh in real-time to create a realistic distortion effect. This implementation allowed rooms to distort over time or based on the player's position.</p>

								<h2 id="colorfull_details">Colorfull</h2>
								<p>The first project using Unreal Engine involved a team of 2 programmers and several artists, working on a 3-week Game Jam. The resulting game is a single-player battle royale with events similar to those in Fall Guys, where the objective is to color the most hexagons within a set time limit. <br />
								My responsibilities for the project included character controls and animation setup, as well as round and event management, while my partner worked on controller support, lobby mechanics, ending screen, round timer, and event symbols. <br />
								In addition to basic movement, players can grab and sabotage each other or use a dash jump to launch opponents away. The game features three events: platform fall, icy ground, and platform shuffle.</p>

								<h2 id="melissa_details">Melissa</h2>
								<p>"Melissa" is a small rogue-like game, slightly inspired by the priest conversion mechanic and engage options in "Age of Empires". With the project beginning at the start of the pandemic, the morale of most team members was low, and some content had to be cut. As a result, my tasks in the project ended up being more than for others. <br />
								My job involved the robots, their controls, behavior, and the player's ability to convert them. I also worked on the map generator, as well as room progression checks and block out room designs.<br />
								The game offers melee and ranged robots that can be sent into attack mode, targeting the first enemy in sight, or defense mode, passing enemies without engaging. Players can attack enemies themselves or use the conversion ability to take them over, which is easier on low health opponents.<br />
							    The map generation algorithm works by randomly selecting a path until it hits an end, then backtracking to the last place where there were multiple path options and taking a different one, until every place is accessible. Finally, a few extra connections are added to make it less linear.</p>

								<h3 id="personal_project_details_dungeongen">Dungeon Generator</h3>
								<p>
									Personally, I am a huge fan of balancing enemy stats and generating surroundings with some extent of variety and randomness. So, most of the years, I end up with a project generating labyrinths, mazes, or a small combat game with stat ranges.<br />
									This years was once again inspired by Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. But I put more work into it than 1 quick afternoon... instead it was a weekend. Biggest inspiration came from <a href=https://pokemon-dungeoneer.vercel.app> "Pokemon Dungeoneer" </a>, I suggest to check it out. I took the main idea of splitting it into areas and using those as the core of the dungeon generation.</p>

								<h3 id="personal_project_details_pixelshader">Pixel Shader</h3>
								<p>
									Something I started working on during my studies was a shader to turn everything into pixel art. I started this project because most artists on campus I talked to enjoyed all different styles of art from 2D to 3D, and I also realized that most of them don't do pixel art. With this, it was decided that even I can write a shader or two.<br />
									It is a post-processing shader using the render of the main camera. Currently, the user can set a custom pixel size, turn on and off a grid for the pixels, change the color calculation between complex and simple, and set the color palette. The color palettes include 8bit, 15bit, 16bit, 24bit, and custom, while custom is currently Unity Editor only.<br />
									Future plans are setting up an outline detection and making custom color palettes work in the game build. With this, every artist can make a game featuring pixel art.
